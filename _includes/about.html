                <p> itâ€™s similar to a "reverse" microwave, a device that instead of warming items quickly, it cools them down!</p>

                <p>FreshWave uses water with Etilenoglicol, an alcohol which gives water the property of not freezing while under -20 degrees Celsius. When an item goes into contact with the liquid, through a resistant, thermally conductive plastic protection, it gets cold. FAST</p>
